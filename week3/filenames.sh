# Filenames
# Write a script named "filenames.sh" that goes through each line of a file.
# If that line contains a valid filename, print “That file exists”.
# If that line contains a directory name, print “That’s a directory”.
# Otherwise print “I don’t know what that is!”.
# Test your new script on “filenames.txt”.
